## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Built-in auto-updater: checks GitHub for newer releases on startup, shows the
  changelog in a notice, and installs the update in place on confirmation.
  Manual check available via the command palette ("Check for Updates").
- Release workflow that publishes per-platform binary assets for each tag.
- Find & Replace: replace and replace-all in the active file, with
  case-sensitive, whole-word and regex toggles (`⌥⌘F`).
- Editing essentials: toggle line comment (`⌘/`), go to line (`⌃G`), move line
  up/down (`⌥↑/↓`), duplicate line (`⇧⌥↓`), delete line (`⌘⇧K`), and
  indent/outdent (`⌘]` / `⌘[`).
- Auto-closing brackets and quotes (with type-over and pair-aware backspace) and
  auto-indent on newline. Configurable via `auto_close`.
- Unsaved-changes confirmation when closing a tab.
- External file-change detection: clean buffers reload automatically; buffers
  with unsaved edits show a reload/keep prompt.
